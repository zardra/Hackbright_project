Knitting charts are a visual representation of a knitting pattern, but many people are intimitdated by the need to learn a whole new, symbolic language in order to read them.  My project allows the user to take a photo of a knitting chart and transform it into written directions.  Uses Python, Flask, JavaScript, SQLAlchemy, Jinga, and HTML5 Canvas.
