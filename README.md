Knitting charts are a visual representation of a knitting pattern, but many people are intimitdated by the need to learn a whole new, symbolic language in order to read them.  My project allows the user to take a photo of a knitting chart and transform it into written directions.  Uses Python, Flask, JavaScript, SQLAlchemy, Jinga, and HTML5 Canvas.


Project Summary
------------

1. The user takes a photo of a knitting chart with their computer's camera.
2. The program runs the image through an OCR engine.
3. The program processes the converted image to interpret the OCR output into English directions.
4. The program generates usable written directions for the user.
